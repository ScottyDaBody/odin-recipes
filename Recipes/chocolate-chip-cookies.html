    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Classic chocolate chip cookies made vegan and gluten-free! Chewy on the inside with crisp buttery edges. Just 1 bowl and 8 ingredients required!</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
           <li>1 Tbsp Flaxseed Meal</li>
           <li>2 1/2 Tbsp Water</li>
           <li>3/4 C Brown Sugar</li>
           <li>1/2 C Softened Vegan Butter</li>
           <li>2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
           <li>1 C Heaping, Gluten Free Flour</li>
           <li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
           <li>1 tsp Sea Salt</li>
           <li>1 C Chocolate Chips</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> To a medium mixing bowl add flaxseed meal and water. Let the mixture gel for 5 minutes. Next add brown sugar and softened vegan butter. Beat with a hand mixer (or stand mixer) on medium-high for about 1 minute until creamed. Add vanilla and beat again for 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Next add gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir on low until just mixed. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips with a rubber spatula. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. When the dough is done chilling, use a cookie scoop to scoop out ~18 cookies, keeping them in mound shapes and spacing 2 inches apart (adjust amount of cookies if altering the default number of servings). Bake for 10-14 minutes â€” until edges are golden and centers are soft. Option to sprinkle with flaky salt for extra flavor!</li>
            <li>Let them rest on the baking sheet to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to fully cool (or you can eat them right away!). Store in an airtight container for 3-5 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.</li>
            
        </ol>
